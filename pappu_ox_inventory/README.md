# Pappu Ox Inventory
A complete inventory system for FiveM, implementing items, weapons, shops, and more without any strict framework dependency.

## Features

- Server-side security ensures interactions with items, shops, and stashes are all validated.
- Logging for important events, such as purchases, item movement, and item creation or removal.
- Supports player-owned vehicles, licenses, and group systems implemented by frameworks.
- Fully synchronised, allowing multiple players to [access the same inventory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65407488/230926091-c0033732-d293-48c9-9d62-6f6ae0a8a488.mp4).
